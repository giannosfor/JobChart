Soon there will be a more thorough description

This is a part of a project I had collaborated with my fellow students. 
We developed a recruitment agency,this portion of code is about the statistics.

You can find snapshot in the description link.

I used JFreeChart for the graphs.

You can download and use Netbeans in order to open it as project.

All the queries are in SQL,I used mySQL Server.
